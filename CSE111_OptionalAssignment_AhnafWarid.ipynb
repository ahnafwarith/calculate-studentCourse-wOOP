        "1. Open a blank Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab file.\n",
        "2. Make 2 “CODE” Segments in the following way:\n",
        "All of your classes will be in the “Class Code” section and all of your Driver code (making objects, calling methods) will be in the Driver Code section.\n",
        "3. Write a class Student such that:\n",
        "Mandatory Parameters: Name, ID, \n",
        "Optional Parameters: gender, DOB\n",
        "Make a new variable “uniqueKey” which concatenates a student’s name + ID. This will not be passed as a parameter, you have to generate this inside constructor yourself and assign it to a “self.uniqueKey” variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implement the following checks in the constructor:\n",
        "\n",
        "ID must have length of 8 digits. Otherwise print “Student ID must have 8 digits” \n",
        "\n",
        "Name must have more than 1 word, and the words will be separated by space. Any single name will not be allowed. E.g: “Robin” is not allowed but “Robin Hood” and “Robin Hood Jr” is allowed. If any invalid name is given, print “Invalid name given”\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Make at least 4 objects of the Student class, to demonstrate how your code works for each scenario. E.g:\n",
        "One object to show it takes the mandatory parameters \n",
        "One object to show it takes both mandatory + optional parameters\n",
        "One object to show it does not take invalid ID\n",
        "One object to show it does not take invalid name\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Write a class Course. What should be the variables of Course class so that it does not become specific to any particular student? E.g: Saving the “grade achieved” or “semester completed” to a course object makes it specific to a particular student. Your “Course” class must have at least 3 variables, and none of the variables should be student-specific. Write an appropriate constructor method.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Write a AddStudent() method in your Course class so that it takes a Student Object, and semester completed as the parameters and saves it to an existing set of student objects. {Hint: use a dictionary to save the Student object and semester completed together}\n",
        "\n",
        "E.g: if CSE111 is a Course object, and StudentA is a Student object, then the driver code will look like this:\n",

        "CSE111.AddStudent(StudentA, “Fall2016”)\n",
        "\n",
        "This code will add StudentA to CSE111’s student list, and will also save “Fall2016” as his semester completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Make 3 objects of your Course class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. In one of your Course objects, add the 2 valid student objects you made in Question 4 using the AddStudent() method.\n"
